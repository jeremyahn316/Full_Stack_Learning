        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I'm currently a Software Engineer at Samsung working mostly in infrastructure, creating tools for other engineers in my department to help with debugging and stress testing. 
            Due to the certain scenarios, we also help with creating stress test scenarios for SSD that is ran on the very tools that we make, in addition to unit tests to ensure that 
            our tools that we provide to other engineers works. I enjoy my team and the work, but wanted to explore and learn about other engineering roles and their skillset.
            This led me to learn more about Full Stack web dev. I always wanted to create application so thought this would be a cool way to start. I hope you enjoy this documentation 
            of my journey and get inspired by me to pursue a similar hobby. Goodluck!
