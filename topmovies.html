        <hr />
        <h3 id="First">Frozen</h3>
        <p>My first Disney princess crush, musical was perfect, and Olaf was the comedy gag that I never knew I needed but got.</p>
        <h3 id="Second">Tangled</h3>
        <p>The original Disney/Pixar that I fell in love with. The musical was also amazing and especially love the duo the main characters sing at the end.</p>
        <h3 id="Third">Your Name</h3>
        <p>My first anime film ever, biggest plot twist and loved the dynamic between the main girl and guy. The concept felt fresh and original.</p>
